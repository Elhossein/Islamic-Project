            <p>The Arabs were the most famous of those who took care of this and was keen on it, and that is why God sent His Messenger from the best tribe and the most honorable lineage. On the authority of Kulaib bin Wael, he said: The stepdaughter of
                the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, spoke to me, Zainab Bint Abi Salamah, who said: (I said to her: Have you seen the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, who was harmful? This was the case in all the messengers
                who were required by the wisdom of God to be of the original lineages and ancient peoples, and therefore the first question Hercules asked about Abu Sufyan, he said: How was his lineage among you? - Meaning the Prophet, may God’s prayers
                and peace be upon him - Abu Sufyan answered: In us he is a lineage - that is, a well-known noble lineage owner - then Hercules said at the conclusion of the questions: I asked you about his lineage, and I mentioned that there is among

            <p>The Prophet Muhammad - may God bless him and grant him peace - has the greatest merit in the civilized upgrading of the Arabs, after the dark ages in Europe, and the vows of ignorance in the Arabian Peninsula, and in this article we try to
                prove this fact, not only from the mouths of Muslim scholars, but from the mouths of thinkers And researchers from non-Muslims. Evelyn Kobeld says: “The Arabs before Muhammad - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - were a nation that
                had no significance, neither its tribes nor its community, and when Muhammad came - may God bless him and grant him peace - he sent this nation a new resurrection that should be closer to miracles and it conquered the world. And it ruled
                over time and future. The Prophet - may God’s prayers and peace be upon him - was able to perform miracles and miracles, when he was able to induce this stubborn Arab nation to reject idols and accept divine oneness, he was successful
                in creating the Arabs a new creation and moving them from darkness to light.</p>
            <div class="text">Our Messenger Muhammad changed our lives and manners for the better.</div>

            <p>Aisha, may God bless her: Quraysh is the most important of which is the woman who was robbed, and they said: Who is the messenger of Allah (pbuh) in it? They said, "Who is he displeased with except Osama bin Zeid, the love of the Messenger
                of Allah (PBUH)?" The word of Osama, he said: "The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) has been removed from one of the limits of Allaah?" If Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, had been robbed, her hand would have been cut off. Look at those who
                have reached the peak in achieving justice (if Fatima bint Muhammad had been robbed, she would have cut off her hand) and she was afraid to do so. Bukhari (3288) and Muslim (1688). From the above, it is clear that doing justice and justice
                among people is great, and therefore the verses are mentioned in the statement of his command and veneration. Our Prophet bestcored the best examples in his achievement of justice among his nation's members.</p>

                let him suffer distress from the distress of the Day of Resurrection. God concealed him in this world and the hereafter. And God is in the help of the servant, what the servant was in the aid of his brother), [1] and also his saying, may
                God’s prayers and peace be upon him: “A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He does not wrong him or betray him. And whoever relieves a Muslim's distress, God will release him from him with distress from the distress of the Day of Resurrection,
                and whoever conceals a Muslim, God will cover him on the Day of Resurrection.)</p>

            <p>The final message of Islam was revealed to the people of the earth at a time that did not know justice, charity, or what is now known as the concepts of freedom, pluralism, or peaceful coexistence. Indeed, the people of this time were dominated
                by the nature of fanaticism, fanaticism and persecution, and only one religion was permitted in one land, but rather one sect, and a single country could not accommodate more than one belief, even if it was invalid. Minorities were not

                was great in his dealings with his Muslim neighbors and others, for example what was previously mentioned in the story of his visit to the Jewish boy, besides that he authorized to receive Knowledge on behalf of non-Muslims, and benefiting
